# Introduction 

## Description of data and data source
This dataset contains variables of height, weight, eye color, age, and gender. I contributed by adding two columns on age and eye color. The eye color variable has values of Green (G), Blue (Bl), and Brown (Br). The age variable contains numberic values >0. 


# Methods 

## Data import and cleaning
I used a provided dataset on height, weight, and gender, while adding variables of eye color and age. I then cleaned the data by making all values numeric, converting to the same unit of measurement, and dropping missing values. 

## Statistical analysis
For statistical analysis, I used linear models to view if there was a relationship between variables. 

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table. All caption text goes here."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable <- readRDS("/Users/katherinelorusso/Desktop/KatherineLorusso-ready-exercise/results/tables/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```


## Basic statistical analysis

The figure below is a scatterplot of Age and Weight, and it can be seen that there is no relationship between the two variables. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","figures","AgeWeight.png"))
```

The figure below is a boxplot of Eye Color and Height. The mean height of those those with Blue eyes is significantly higher than those with Brown. 
```{r}
#| label: figure-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and Eye Color Box Plot."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","figures","HeightEyeColor.png"))
```

## Full analysis
The analysis below is the results of a linear model with Eye color and age as the predictors and height as the outcome. 
```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 <- readRDS(here("results","tables","resulttable3.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```
